Some major bugfixes have made testing with focus groups much easier.

Previously, the only functionality that could be confidentely tested was sending the drawing.
Now, live calling and recording is much more stable.

The major improvements are:
 - Call status displays are fixed if you call from one person to another
 - Recordings that regularly failed on computer browsers are now more stable
 - The login screen flicker on app startup on mobile has been resolved

Focus group testing can now be a lot more fruitful with all these features fixed!
