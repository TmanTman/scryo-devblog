title: Welcome to the new blog
---
I'm brimming with excitement to show off all the features and additions to Scryo on this blog! The goal of this blog is to easily demonstrate new features or experimentations to Scryo. This provides an easy platform to link anyone to when a new feature is under discussion.

Although things may change, at this particular stage Scryo will be publicly available, but account registration is limited to focus groups. The reason for this is that the application is that developer time is focused on proving that this app is useful, to determine barriers to entry, and in addition to being a great communication tool to research opportunities for delivering services or products through the application. There are a lot of bugs and it's still necessary to personally work with the users to determine how the application fits into their day-to-day work.

All the best,

Tielman
